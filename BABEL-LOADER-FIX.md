# 🔧 Babel-Loader Error Fix

## ❌ Error
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'babel-loader'
```

## ✅ Solution

The error was caused by an incorrect webpack configuration in `next.config.js`. Next.js has its own built-in transpilation and doesn't need babel-loader.

### What I Fixed:

1. **Removed babel-loader configuration** from webpack config
2. **Simplified webpack fallbacks** to only include necessary Node.js modules
3. **Added client-side only configuration** to prevent server-side issues
4. **Cleared Next.js cache** to remove old webpack configurations

### Updated webpack config:
```javascript
webpack: (config, { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, webpack }) => {
  // Custom webpack configuration for client-side only
  if (!isServer) {
    config.resolve.fallback = {
      ...config.resolve.fallback,
      fs: false,
      net: false,
      tls: false,
      crypto: false,
      stream: false,
      util: false,
      url: false,
      assert: false,
      http: false,
      https: false,
      os: false,
      buffer: false,
    };
  }
  
  return config;
},
```

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Restart Development (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev:restart
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps
```bash
# 1. Clear cache
cd frontend-web
npm run clear-cache

# 2. Restart development
cd ..
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Clean Development
```bash
# Clear everything and restart
cd frontend-web
npm run dev:clean
```

## ✅ Expected Results

After applying the fix:
- ✅ No babel-loader errors
- ✅ Webpack builds successfully
- ✅ Development server starts without errors
- ✅ Hot reload works properly
- ✅ No module resolution errors

## 🔍 Why This Happened

1. **Incorrect webpack config**: Added babel-loader rule that Next.js doesn't need
2. **Next.js built-in transpilation**: Next.js uses SWC for transpilation, not Babel
3. **Cache issues**: Old webpack configurations were cached

## 🛠️ Prevention

- Don't add babel-loader to Next.js webpack config
- Use Next.js built-in transpilation (SWC)
- Clear cache when making webpack changes
- Test webpack changes incrementally

## 📋 Verification

Check that these work:
1. Development server starts without errors
2. No babel-loader errors in console
3. Hot reload functions properly
4. Frontend loads at http://localhost:3000
5. Backend responds at http://localhost:5000

The fix is now applied and the application should work correctly! 🎉
